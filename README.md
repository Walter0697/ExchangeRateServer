## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Here is a simple instruction for running this server

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Postgres Database

First, you will need to copy `config.example.toml` into a preferrable name, in the following example, we will use `config.toml`

Change the configuration to match your preferred database inside `config.toml`

Please be aware that the serving port of this application is `80`, if you want to change it, you should do it in both `config.toml` and `Dockerfile`

Before building the app, you should seed the database will the following command
```
go run main seed
```

You can also run the above command inside Docker container if you are running with deteched mode

Run the following command to build the image
```
docker built -t server/backend:<tag>
```

Then, use the following command to run this image, you will need to map the config file to docker in order to successfully run this application
```
docker run -v ${pwd}/config.toml:/app/config.toml --rm -p 80:80 server/backend:<tag>
```
